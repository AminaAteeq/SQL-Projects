Project: Retail Sales Data Analysis
Project Description:
In this project, I analyzed a retail sales dataset to uncover insights related to product sales, customer behavior, and regional performance.
The dataset includes sales transactions, products, customers, and regions. By utilizing SQL queries, I created reports that helped the company 
understand key metrics such as total sales, sales per product, regional performance, and customer spending patterns.


Project Outcome:
Through the SQL queries and analysis, I was able to provide valuable insights into:
The overall performance of products and sales revenue.
Customer purchasing patterns and how spending varies by age group.
Regional sales performance, helping the company target areas with high growth potential.
Product performance and inventory management by identifying products that sell quickly or are understocked.
